# How to use

Either build your own client & server or download the one from releases.

## Server
You can simply run it just by running ```java -jar skidchat-server.jar``` and it will create a configuration file.
You can exit the server simply by just running ```exit``` inside the shell.

## Client
The client has pretty straight-forward GUI, you add the server you want to connect to, set username and password and connect. Easy as that.
